Tasker is a library/tool for keeping track of tasks. 

It is meant to be quite simple so the actual library consists of two classes
and a small number of messages. 

A task consists of a series of notes and is able to be opened, closed,
postponed, and reopened. A note is an immutable piece of information that is
attached to a task to give it context

This tool now depends on electron with environment variable support. It also
now uses the electron filesystem to make it a self-contained application.
==============================================================================
The README accompanying the electron-filesystem:


This is the default filesystem that I use to write self contained programs that
use electron. This is possible due to the inclusion of shell variable access in
newer versions of electron.


The default file system is as follows

bin/ - binaries, shell scripts, and initializer electron code
lib/ - electron library code (use the import command to take advantage of it)
etc/ - contains files that define program variables and other such things
data/ - contains files generated by the program
src/ - contains the electron source code. DO NOT PUT YOUR ELECTRON FILES HERE.
       IF YOU DO THEN YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING IT INTO THE LIB FOLDER

It should be noted that it is up to the programmer to customize this base
filesystem to suit their needs.
